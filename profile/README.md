## üåü Vision

Guva is a revolutionary decentralized platform that democratizes AI content creation by connecting LoRA creators, users, and GPU miners in a seamless ecosystem. We're building the future where anyone can access, create, and monetize AI-generated content through a web2-like experience powered by web3 technology.

## üöÄ Mission

To create the world's most accessible and fair AI content marketplace for stable diffusion, where creativity is rewarded, computing power is democratized, and users can generate stunning AI content without technical barriers.

## üí° Core Concept

### **The LoRA NFT Marketplace**
Imagine a world where AI models (LoRAs) are not just tools, but valuable digital assets that creators can monetize. Guva transforms LoRAs into tradeable NFTs, creating a vibrant marketplace where:

- **Miners** provide GPU computing power and earn rewards
- **Everyone** benefits from a fair, transparent ecosystem

### **The ‚ö°Ô∏è Economy**
At the heart of Guva is our unique energy token (‚ö°Ô∏è) that powers the entire ecosystem:

- **Users** convert PyUSD/USDC to ‚ö°Ô∏è to access AI generation
- **Creators** earn ‚ö°Ô∏è when their LoRAs are used
